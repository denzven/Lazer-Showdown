## ✦ What Is Lazer Showdown?

**Lazer Showdown** is a two-player tactical board game played on an **8×8 grid** filled with fixed diagonal mirrors. One player is the **Attacker**, wielding a laser piece. The other is the **Defender**, protecting high-value point pieces by repositioning them around the board.

A roll of the dice determines your **Action Points**. Use them to move your piece, rotate the laser, and fire — but every shot bounces off the board's mirrors unpredictably. Mastering the geometry of the beam is the key to victory.

> *"The original name was 'La-Sir-She-Dan' — Battle of the Land at Ser. The humans couldn't pronounce it. So they called it Lazer Showdown. And somehow, that name ended a war."*

---

## 🎮 Game Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🌐 **Online (WebRTC)** | Real-time peer-to-peer multiplayer. Share a 6-character room code with a friend. No server needed. |
| 👥 **Local Pass & Play** | Two players sharing one device, taking turns. Perfect for sitting across from each other. |
| 🤖 **vs. Computer** | Challenge one of three AI opponents, each with a unique personality and playstyle. |

---

## 📋 The Rules

> *This is a condensed summary. The full official ruleset is inside the game under* **Rules***.*

### 🏗️ Structure
```
GAME  ─→  2 SETS
SET   ─→  3 ROUNDS
ROUND ─→  Defender's Roll  +  Attacker's Roll
```

### ⚙️ Setup
1. **Toss** — Both players roll one die. The higher roller wins and **chooses their role**.
2. **Defender** places **3 Point Pieces** anywhere on the board *except* the four corners.
3. **Attacker** places the **LAZER Piece** on any corner square, facing any direction.

### 🎲 Your Turn (Rolling & Actions)
- Roll **both dice** — the total is your **Action Points (AP)**.
- Spend each AP on one of three actions:

| Action | Cost | Who Can Use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **MOVE** | 1 AP | Attacker moves LAZER 1 square (H/V only). Defender moves a Point Piece 1 square. |
| **ROTATE** | 1 AP | Attacker rotates the LAZER piece clockwise or counter-clockwise. |
| **LAZER PRESS** | 1 AP | Fires the laser. It travels, bounces off mirrors, and captures any Point Piece it hits. |

- Actions can be taken in **any order**.
- Unused AP is **forfeited**.

### 💥 The Laser
When fired, the laser travels in a straight line until it:
- **Bounces** off a `/` or `\` mirror (90° reflection).
- **Captures** a Point Piece (piece is removed, points awarded to Attacker).
- **Exits** the board.

Mirror loops are detected and broken automatically to prevent infinite bouncing.

### 🏆 Scoring & Objectives

| Piece | Points |
|-------|--------|
| Small Piece | 20 pts |
| Medium Piece | 30 pts |
| Large Piece | 50 pts |

- **Attacker** wants to capture all pieces and score as many points as possible.
- **Defender** wants to evade capture, delay the attacker, and survive all 3 rounds.

### ⚡ Challenge Mechanic
If the Attacker captures **all 3 pieces** before the set ends, they may declare a **CHALLENGE**:

1. The Attacker nominates one previously captured piece.
2. A **toss** is rolled (one die per player).
3. **Attacker wins toss** → Defender re-places all pieces; the game continues. If the challenged piece is captured again, its value is **added** to the score.
4. **Attacker loses toss** → The nominated piece's value is **deducted** from the Attacker's score.

Multiple challenges can occur in a single set!

### 🔄 Between Sets
After Set 1, **roles are swapped**. The former Attacker becomes the Defender, and vice versa. Scores carry over. The player with the **highest total score** after both sets wins. A tie is a **DRAW**.

## 🌌 The Lore

> *The full lore archive is accessible in-game via the **"GRID TERMINAL ARCHIVES"** section.*

### Chapter I — The Great Discovery (3021 AD)

The war on **Planet Ser** had reached a brutal stalemate. In the dead of night, allied scouts observed alien commanders playing a mysterious game with living creatures on stone grids. They heard its name whispered: **"La-Sir-She-Dan"** — *Battle of the Land at Ser*.

Back at base, the name became **"Lazer Showdown"** — and what had been the enemy's battle simulation became humanity's most valuable intelligence asset.

### Chapter II — The Strategic Breakthrough

A cryptographer made a terrifying discovery: the placement of pieces on the alien game boards **perfectly matched the coordinates of their fleet ships in orbit**. It wasn't a pastime. It was a **real-time tactical simulation**.

By reverse-engineering the game with mirrors and rudimentary lasers, human soldiers began to predict alien flanking maneuvers — days before they occurred.

### Chapter III — The Treaty of 3042

In **3042 AD**, the **Intergalactic Treaty of Kylos** was signed, ending decades of war. Lazer Showdown was no longer a weapon of intelligence — it became a bridge between civilizations. Today it is played across the galaxy as a sport of diplomacy.

---

## 👾 Alien Bestiary

The creatures from Planet Ser that inspired the game pieces.

### 🔦 The Lzrshuby — *The Laser*
> *"Tickle its foot. That's all it takes."*

A furry, baseball-sized creature from the **High-Energy Vents of Planet Ser**. It feeds on ambient radiation, making it essentially a living battery. When startled or tickled, it vents excess radiation through a singular ocular lens — creating a focused beam of pure energy.

In the human version of the game, the **Attacker's Laser Piece** is modeled after the Lzrshuby.

### 🪨 The Mirlug — *The Mirror*
> *"99.9% reflectivity. Even plasma just bounces right off."*

A slow-moving gastropod from the **Silicon Caves of Planet Ser**. Its shell is composed of high-density, naturally polished silicon — so reflective it can redirect high-energy plasma beams with near-perfect efficiency.

During the war, Mirlugs were used as tactical redirection pads. In the game, **Mirror pieces** are modeled after their extraordinary shells.

---

## 🤖 AI Opponents

Three alien contenders await in Bot Mode, each with a distinct personality coded directly into their decision engine.

### 🟢 Zlorooklp — *Veteran Scout (Easy)*
> *"He views the game as a casual hobby. He's here for the pretty lights."*

One of the first aliens to play a friendly match with a human after the ceasefire. Forgiving and experimental. He has a **15% chance to simply skip an action** to "see what happens."

**AI Behavior:** Picks moves at random from the legal action pool. Occasionally forfeits AP on purpose.

---

### 🟡 Lizbishmir — *Tactical Scholar (Medium)*
> *"She believes every move has a perfect geometric counter."*

A scholar of the Ser battlefields, obsessed with the mathematical precision of the grid. Methodical and balanced — she rarely makes aggressive mistakes.

**AI Behavior (Attacker):** Prioritizes immediate captures → rotation setups → positional movement toward the closest piece.
**AI Behavior (Defender):** Moves pieces toward the **center** of the board for maximum coverage. Evades targeted pieces first.

---

### 🔴 Shahlzrmir — *High-Command Marshal (Hard)*
> *"He has never forgotten a single ship placement from the war."*

A high-ranking officer from the original conflict. Plays with cold, calculating efficiency. Uses Action Points to trap opponents in inescapable configurations.

**AI Behavior (Attacker):** Same capture-first logic as Lizbishmir, but relentlessly aggressive.
**AI Behavior (Defender):** Moves pieces toward **board edges** for a perimeter defense. Evades threats first, then repositions to maximize distance from the laser.

---

## 🗺️ Custom Boards

Lazer Showdown ships with **5 distinct board configurations**, each offering a unique mirror pattern that radically changes the tactical landscape.

| Board | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Default** | The classic 8-mirror layout from `Ruleset.js`. |
| **Chakra** | A radially symmetric pattern with central mirror clusters. |
| **Lotus** | Balanced positioning mirroring the Chakra, with alternate orientations. |
| **Split** | A sparse 4-mirror board that favors direct shots. |
| **Veil** | A 6-mirror layout designed to occlude laser paths. |
| **X-Force** | A dense 12-mirror cross-pattern creating complex reflection chains. |

The board layout is **fixed for the entire game**. Mirrors cannot be moved. Every strategy must be built around the beam geometry they create.

---

## 🔗 Networking Architecture (WebRTC)

Lazer Showdown uses **100% peer-to-peer networking** — no game server is required.

```
Player 1 (Host)                         Player 2 (Joiner)
     │                                        │
     │── registers peer ID ─────────────────► │
     │   "lazershowdown-XXXXXX"               │
     │                                        │
     │◄────── PeerJS signaling server ────────│
     │           (discovery only)             │
     │                                        │
     │◄════════ WebRTC DataChannel ═══════════│
     │        (direct P2P game data)          │
```

1. **Host** creates a room → a unique **6-character room code** is generated (e.g., `KRTV4Y`).
2. The host registers as a PeerJS peer with the ID `lazershowdown-XXXXXX`.
3. **Joiner** enters the code → connects directly to the host's peer.
4. A **handshake** is performed to exchange player names and session IDs.
5. All game state actions (`move`, `rotate`, `laser-press`, etc.) are broadcast via the DataChannel.
6. **Full room protection** — a second joiner attempting to connect to an active room receives a `ROOM_FULL` rejection.

### Resilience Features
- 🔄 **Auto-reconnect** — if a tab is closed and reopened, the session is restored from `localStorage`.
- 💤 **AFK detection** — the Page Visibility API monitors tab focus; opponents are notified if you go AFK for 5+ seconds.
- 🔁 **Room code collision retry** — if a room ID is already taken, the host auto-generates a new one (up to 3 retries).

### Key Design Decisions

- **Immutable State** — `GameState.js` is a pure reducer: `(board, action, player, context) → nextState`. No mutation; every action returns a fresh state snapshot.
- **Laser Tracing** — `traceLaserBeam()` uses a visited-set keyed by `(r, c, dr, dc)` to prevent infinite mirror loops. Returns the full beam path for the renderer.
- **Bot as Sandbox Player** — The bot uses the same `applySandboxAction()` as a human. It's an AI that simply picks the action; no special code paths needed.
- **No Backend** — Zero game server. State sync happens over WebRTC DataChannels. PeerJS's signaling server is only used for the initial connection handshake.
